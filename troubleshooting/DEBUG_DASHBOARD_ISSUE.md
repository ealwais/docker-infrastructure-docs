# Debug Dashboard Issue

## Current Situation
- Dashboard at `/family-dashboard/home` is not updating despite file changes
- File `/config/dashboard_family_final.yaml` has been modified multiple times
- Even replaced with "TESTING 123" but no change visible
- Home Assistant has been restarted
- No storage mode files found
- Browser cache cleared

## To Debug in Browser

1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Navigate to Family dashboard**
4. **Look for requests to**:
   - `dashboard_family_final.yaml`
   - Any JSON requests
   - Any 404 errors

5. **In Console tab**, run:
   ```javascript
   // Check if there's a service worker
   navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(function(registrations) {
     for(let registration of registrations) {
       registration.unregister();
     }
   });
   ```

## Possible Issues

1. **Service Worker Caching**
   - HA uses service workers for offline access
   - They can aggressively cache dashboards

2. **Wrong Configuration Path**
   - Maybe the dashboard is configured elsewhere
   - Could be loading from a different file entirely

3. **Frontend Module Issue**
   - The frontend might be compiled with the dashboard

## Nuclear Option

If nothing else works:
```bash
# Stop HA
docker stop homeassistant

# Clear all caches
docker exec homeassistant rm -rf /config/.storage/frontend*

# Start HA
docker start homeassistant
```
